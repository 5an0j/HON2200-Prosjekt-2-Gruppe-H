2 | Brazilian Artificial Intelligence Strategy

INTRODUCTION

EBIA was established with the aim of guiding the actions of the Brazilian
government in favor of the development of actions, in its various aspects, that
stimulate research, innovation and development of Al solutions, as well as, their
conscious and ethical use. The concept of Al adopted is that presented by the OECD:
“an Al system is a machine-based system that can, for a given set of objectives
defined by human, make predictions, recommendations or decisions that influence
real or virtual environments. Al systems are designed to operate with varying levels
of autonomy”. Also, according to the OECD, an Al system consists of three main
elements: sensors, operational logic and actuators. The sensors collect raw data
from the environment, processed by operational logic to provide outputs to the
actuators, which in turn act to change the state of the environment. This cycle is
repeated countless times, and as the environment is changed by the Al system,
each cycle the operational logic can be improved.

1. INTERNATIONAL REFERENCES

Still referring to these OECD recommendations on Al, the document cites the
following points as key issues to be addressed by EBIA:

+ Al must benefit people and the planet, driving inclusive growth, sustainable
development and well-being.

- Alsystems must be designed in a manner that respects the rule of law, human
rights, democratic values and diversity, and must include appropriate safeguards -
for example, enabling human intervention whenever necessary - to ensure a fair
society.

* Organizations and individuals who play an active role in the Al lifecyc
must commit to transparency and responsible disclosure in relation to Al system
providing relevant and state of the art information that will (i) promote the genera
understanding of Al systems; (ii) making people aware of their interactions with
Al systems; (ii) allowing those affected by an Al system to understand the resul
produced; and (iv) allow those adversely affected by an Al system to contest i
outcome.

- Al systems must operate in a robust, safe and protected manner throughout
their life cycles, and potential risks must be assessed and managed on an ongoing
basis.

In addition, the EBIA emphasizes that the principles defined by the OECD in
this same recommendation are its guiding principles for responsible management
of Al systems, namely: (i) inclusive growth, sustainable development and well-being;

(ii) human-centered values and equity; (iii) transparency and explainability; (iv
robustness, security and protection and; (v) accountability.

In addition to discussions within the OECD, the MCTI also paid attention to the
efforts made by countless countries to develop policies, strategies or plans to dea
with the issue. Among such initiatives, the main axes identified, according to EBIA,
were:

* Research and Development: attracting, retaining and training Al talent from
he country itself or from abroad, with academic funding, scholarship programs and
he creation of specific master’s and doctoral programs in Al; create new centers or
programs in basic and applied research, specific to Al.

+ Professional skills and the future of work: initiatives to empower the workforce,
in general, that develop skills for the future of work, such as investment in lifelong
education and digital skills.

+ Industrialization and Al: programs to encourage the adoption of Al techno-
ogies by the private sector, with investments in strategic sectors, financing for Al

startups, in small and medium companies, strategies to create clusters for Al.

+ Ethical standards for Al: creation of councils, committees or task forces to
develop norms and regulations, to support the ethical use and development of A\
This theme also includes specific funding for research or pilot programs to create
explainable and transparent Al.

* Data Governance and Digital Infrastructure: financing for partnership
involving the use of open data, shared Al software development platforms and dat
sets, as well as a commitment to create test environments to protect citizens’ rights.

* Alin Government: establishment of pilot programs that use Al to improve the
efficiency of Government, service delivery and Public Administration.

: Al for social well-being: designing programs to ensure that Al is used to
promote social well-being, economic and cultural growth, and to promote inclusion
through its applications.

THEMATIC AXES

1. LEGISLATION, REGULATION AND ETHICAL USE

The technological development of Artificial Intelligence has been accompanied
by intense discussions about the need to develop legal, regulatory and ethica
parameters to guide the development and application of technology. At the center
of such debates is the concern to establish a balance between (i) the protection and
safeguarding of rights, including those associated with the protection of persona
data and the prevention of discrimination and algorithmic bias; (ii) the preserva-
tion of adequate structures to encourage the development of a technology whose
potential has not yet been fully understood; and (iii) the establishment of lega
parameters that provide legal certainty regarding the responsibility of the different
actors that participate in the value chain of autonomous systems.

It was highlighted that the debates about the establishment of genera
principles and ethical parameters to be adopted by public and private actors on
the subject have gained prominence, through codes of conduct, manuals of best
practices and high-level guidelines. References cited were the OECD' and G20 A
principles’; Ethical Guidelines for a European Union Trusted Al; among others.

Many of the documents cited by
EBIA indicate that the development of
Artificial Intelligence must observe the
harmonization of the principles that
guide the notionofthe rule oflaw,sothat
it benefits the society, driving inclusive
growth, sustainable development and
well-being. To promote an institutiona
and regulatory environment conducive
to innovation and_ technologica
development, given its rapidly evolving
nature, the document recognizes that
there is a scenario in which regulation is complex and prone to become obsolete
quickly, and are at risk of preventing the responsible development and use of Al.

In addition, it is often stated
that systems must be designed
in a way that respects human
rights, democratic values and
diversity, imposing the inclusion of

appropriate safeguards that enable
human intervention, whenever
necessary, to guarantee a just
society.

Therefore, it is concluded that, in view of the gradual process of large-scale
adoption of Alin Brazil andthe recent entry into force of the General Data Protection
Law (LGPD), which addresses several issues related to the use of Al, the EBIA adopts
the understanding that it is necessary to deepen the study of the impacts of Al
in different sectors, avoiding regulatory actions (in a broad sense) that may unne-
cessarily limit Al innovation, adoption and development. However, it argues that
concerns about human dignity and the enhancement of human well-being must be
present from the conception of these solutions to the verification of their effects on
the reality of citizens (ethics by design), making ethical principles be followed in all
stages of Al development and use, and may even be raised to normative require-
ments to be part of all governmental initiatives regarding Al.

+ To stimulate the production of an ethical Al by financing research projects
that aim to apply ethical solutions, mainly in the fields of fairness, accountability and
transparency, known as the matrix FAT.

* To encourage partnerships with corporations that are researching commercial
solutions for these ethical Al technologies.

To establish as a technical requirement in tenders that bidders offer solutions
compatible with the promotion of ethical Al (for example, establish that facial
recognition technology solutions acquired by public agencies have a false positive
percentage below a certain threshold).

* To establish, in a multisectoral way, spaces for the discussion and definition
of ethical principles to be observed in the research, development and use of Al.

+ To map out legal and regulatory barriers to the development of Al in Brazil
and identify aspects of the Brazilian legislation that may require updates, in order
to promote greater legal certainty for the digital ecosystem.

+ To stimulate actions of transparency and responsible disclosure regarding
the use of Al systems, and promote the observance, by such systems, of human
rights, democratic values and diversity.

To develop techniques to identify and mitigate the risk of algorithmic bias.

To develop data quality control policy for the training of Al systems.

* To create parameters about human intervention in Al contexts where the
result of an automated decision implies a high risk of harm to the individual.

* To encourage the exploration and development of appropriate review
mechanisms in different contexts of use of Al by private organizations and public
bodies.

2. Al GOVERNANCE

As discussions about the ethical use of Al advance, so do the debates
about governance frameworks that promote methods and procedures to ensure
compliance with these principles. Reference is made to the government of
Singapore, As discussions about the ethical use of Al advance, so do the debates
about governance frameworks that promote methods and procedures to ensure
compliance with these principles. Reference is made to the government of Singapore,
which launched the first edition of a “Model Al Governance Framework" that seeks
to translate ethical principles into implementable practices in the Al development
process.

A fundamental aspect of this process, according to the EBIA, is to establish
mechanisms that allow the prevention and elimination of biases, which can resul
both from the algorithms used, as well as from the databases used for their training.
For an algorithm to be “explainable” or “interpretable”, it is desirable that the stages
of the machine learning process that resulted in an inference are traceable and that
the variables that weighed in decision making can be scrutinized. Based on this,
it refers to the concept of accountability and the importance of implementing A
governance structures in this regard.

4. QUALIFICATIONS FOR A DIGITAL FUTURE
(EDUCATION)

In the field of education, the challenge is to prepare current and future
generations to live with the changes and impacts of Al, many of which are not yet fully
understood. It is mentioned that some countries already offer training in the area
of computing based on the principles and methods used by Al, such as platforms of
introduction to non-deterministic programming, use of computational thinking in a
non-deterministic way, education based on robotics and other techniques specific
to area.

The document states that qualifying for
a world with Al involves more than science,

solutions.

In relation to the labor market, the importance of digital literacy is considered
even more latent. Many employers, right at the stage of evaluating job applications,
require mastery of digital skills, which act as a catalyst, training other important
skills. It is essential, according to the EBIA, that each citizen master basic digital skills
and have key competences to apply in various professional activities.

@); Strategic actions - Education

- To assess the possibility of updating the Common National Curriculum Base
(BNCC) in a way that more clearly incorporates elements related to computational
thinking and computer programming.

- To develop digital literacy program in all areas of education and at all levels
of education.

- To expand offer of undergraduate and graduate courses linked to Artificial
Intelligence.

To stimulate the development of interpersonal and emotional skills, such as
creativity and critical thinking (soft skills).

MINISTRY OF SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATIONS | C7!

- To evaluate ways of incorporating Al technologies in school environments
that take into account the peculiar condition of children and adolescents as people
in development, as well as their personal data protection rights.

MINISTRY OF SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATIONS | C7!

: To institute technological training programs for teachers and educators.

+ To add courses in data science, linear algebra, calculus and probability and
statistics to the list of complementary activities in high school programs.

* To promote interaction programs between the private sector and educational
institutions that allow the exchange of practical knowledge on the development and
use of Artificial Intelligence technologies.

* To create mechanisms to increase the interest of Brazilians in STEM group
subjects at school age, with a special focus on gender and race inclusion programs
in these areas.

5. WORKFORCE AND TRAINING

It recognizes that there will be a growing demand for skills related to technology,
both in the field of basic digital skills and also in the area of advanced technologi-
cal skills, such as computer programming, advanced skills in digital literacy, critical
thinking and problem solving. It is believed that important changes will occur,
involving the creation of new jobs and the disappearance or transformation of
others.

Training, and its continuity over time, plays a very important role in preparing
the workforce, not only in view of the creation of new functions and careers, but
also to better adapt current professionals to the changes required due to the use
of technology.

Strategic actions - Workforce and training

* To establish partnerships with the private sector and academia to define
concrete public policies that encourage the training and qualification of professio-
nals, considering the new realities of the labor market.

* To encourage companies and public agencies to implement a continuous
training program for their workforce focused on new technologies.

: To create awareness campaigns on the importance of preparing for the
development and ethical use of Al.

- To stimulate the retention of ICT-specialized talents in Brazil.

- To create public policies that encourage the training and qualification of pro-
fessionals, keeping in mind the new realities of the labor market.

- To encourage the diverse composition of Al development teams, in terms of
gender, race, sexual orientation and other socio-cultural aspects.

* To reinforce policies aimed at continuing education and lifelong learning,
promoting greater interaction between the private sector and educational institu-
tions (universities, research institutes and professional and technical training).

6. RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, INNOVATION AND
ENTREPRENEURSHIP

The EBIA again cites the OECD recommendation on Al, emphasizing that
national states should promote and encourage public and private investments in
R&D, contemplating interdisciplinary efforts to promote innovation in reliable Al,
in order to focus not only on technical challenges, but also on social, legal and
ethical implications associated with Al. In addition, the document recommends that
governments enable investments in open databases, which should be representa-
ive and respect the rights to privacy and protection of personal data, in order to (i)
promote an environment for research and development in Al that is free from bias;
and (ii) improve interoperability and the use of common standards. In addition to
hese aspects, the OECD also indicates that governments should promote a public
policy environment that supports an agile transition from the R&D phase to the
development and operation phase of Al systems.

In the understanding of MCTI, Artificial Intelligence Research and Development
must adopt ethical design approaches to make the system reliable. This may include,
but is not limited to: making the system as fair as possible, reducing possible dis-
crimination and prejudice, improving its transparency, providing explanation and
predictability and making the system more traceable, auditable and accountable.

In addition, with regard to public policies aimed at RD&l, for categorization
purposes, EBIA identified three categories of government action:

(i) Financier or direct investor: governments can provide financing to support
the development and adoption of emerging technologies, with practical application
in the public sector, as well as private sector R&D projects whose results can apply
to the entire economy.

ii) Flexible regulator: Accelerated innovation cycles in emerging digital techno-
logies require rethinking the types of policies and regulatory instruments used and
their implementation. Legal certainty is essential to guarantee investment.

iii) Data administrator: Governments own or maintain vast databases. This
data can power Al-based technologies, especially when well managed.

EBIA also recognizes the importance of adopting regulatory sandboxes in order
to support organizations that are developing innovative products and services using
personal data and to develop a shared understanding of what compliance is like in
specific innovative areas. As an example, it cited the “Sandbox Guide” developed by
the Information Commissioner's Office, designed to guide entrepreneurs who want
to develop innovative businesses safely .

To improve interoperability and the use of common standards.

* To promote incentive mechanisms that encourage the development of Al
systems that adopt ethical principles and values.

7. APPLICATION IN THE PRODUCTIVE SECTORS

In the industry, Artificial Intelligence will play a key role in making business
more effective, with reduced costs and a minimum operational error rate. It can
be used in different sectors, automating a series of processes and making the
day-to-day business more flexible and agile. Thus, entrepreneurs will be able to
dedicate more time to activities close to the enterprise’s core business and less
to bureaucratic and operational issues. Industries with large assembly lines, for
example, can use Artificial Intelligence to decrease the number of errors in product
assembly processes.

It recognizes that among the challenges to establish public Al policies, is to
identify the branches of use of Al and the market areas in which the investments
to be applied can generate the best results. These areas can give visibility to the
country in international terms, generate jobs with better qualifications, attract large
IT companies in the offer of technological solutions, generate Al products and appli-
cations for the diverse needs of the public and private sectors and, also, prepare
the country for the need for requalification that technology has been imposing on
a global level.

Strategic actions - Application in the productive
sectors

* To define or identify a public-private governance framework to promote the
advancement of intelligent IT industries, along the lines of the Brazilian Chamber of
Industry 4.0.

* To foster the emergence of new Brazilian Startups in the area through new
publicprivate partnerships.

* To create collaboration networks between technology-based startups and
small and medium-sized companies (SMEs).

* To incorporate in initiatives such as the Brasil Mais Program incentive
mechanisms for the use of Al by small and medium-sized companies, in order to
improve management processes and promote their digital transformation.

8. APPLICATION IN THE PUBLIC POWER

The idea of digital government presupposes taking advantage of and incorpo-
rating scientific and technological advances in the field of data science and artificial
intelligence in the creation of solutions to improve public services. The combination
of data science, automatic learning and high computational power constitutes an
important contribution to transform the large amount of data available in Public
Administration into relevant information (finding patterns) and transformative
knowledge (anticipating failures and optimizing actions). These transformations
may modify the decision-making processes, relating to matters with a critical impact
on the lives of citizens, and also improve operational processes, reducing deadlines
and obtaining more effective responses to the needs presented.

It recognizes that the Public Power has an important role in promoting the
adoption of Al, creating an enabling environment for its full development. This
should start with the adoption of responsible Al technologies in the public sector,
in order to improve the quality of the service offered to the citizen, to promote a
transparent and efficient interaction, to increase the level of public confidence in
the government and to generate better results for the citizens.

Strategic actions - Application to the public
authorities

+ In line with the provisions of the Digital Government Strategy, to implement
Artificial Intelligence resources in at least 12 federal public services by 2022.

- To incorporate Al and data analysis into public policy formulation processes.

MINISTRY OF SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATIONS | C7!

* To implement data experimentation spaces with Al and develop Al-oriented
RD&l partnerships with higher education institutions, the private sector and the
third sector.

18 | Brazilian Artificial Intelligence Strategy

* To update and reassess work processes and practices, in preparation for
possible changes in the environments in which Al systems are introduced.

* To consider, in tenders and administrative contracts aimed at the acquisition
of Artificial Intelligence products and services, criteria aimed not only at technical
efficiency, but also related to the incorporation of ethical principles related to trans-
parency, equity and non-discrimination.

* To establish mechanisms for swift investigation of complaints and complaints
about violations of rights in decisions made by Al systems.

* To promote the exchange of open data between Public Administration
entities and between them and the private sector, always with respect to the right
to the protection of personal data and trade secrets.

* To conduct impact analysis on Al use cases that directly affect the citizen or
the public servant.

* To establish ethical values for the use of Al in the Federal Public Administra-
tion.

* To encourage public bodies to promote awareness of the use of Al in their
staff.

9. PUBLIC SECURITY

Artificial Intelligence systems have potential applications in numerous activities
related to security and defense, whether in the context of the Public Power or in the
private sector. One of the main applications of Al in the field of security concerns
solutions that allow the identification of objects and people in images and videos,
which can be used in simple applications - such as the detection of a person jumping
over a wall - even applications that are able to identify people carrying guns on the
street and/or assaulting others.

On the other hand, the use of such technologies has also been widely discussed,
mainly with regard to the problems associated with bias and discrimination arising,
in many cases, from insufficiently representative training databases. Although facial
recognition systems for public security have been adopted in a number of contexts,
including in Brazil, the rates of false positive identifications raise concerns.

Taking into account the opportunities and challenges of using Al within
this sector, EBIA identifies some measures that would guarantee technological
development and the protection of personal data:

(i) Soft law mechanisms: Guides and recommendations that assist regulators
and regulated parties in applying the normative provisions of the relevant laws.
Examples include the ICO, the European Data Protection Supervisor and the NIST.

MINISTRY OF SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATIONS | C7!

(ii) Supervisory structure: Supervisory structures usually include one or more
representative parties legitimized by the State that have instruments to guarantee

Brazilian Artificial Intelligence Strategy 15

the applicability of the law (enforcement), as well as the recommendation of best
practices and other safeguards.

(iii) Adoption of technical norms or standards (standardization): Technical
norms and standards are established by the technical-scientific communities, in
order to guide the industry in the development and implementation of technologi-
cal solutions. An internationally recognized organization for standards publication
is the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

(iv) Data protection regulations applied to public security: The processing
of data in the context of public security requires a specific law, since this topic is
outside the scope of the LGPD.

(v) Implementation of a regulatory sandbox: The regulatory sandbox is an
important regulatory technique that allows transparency regarding technological
solutions developed by private or state entities.

Strategic actions - Public security

* To establish supervisory mechanisms to monitor the use of Al for public
security activities.

* To encourage bodies that use Al for monitoring to submit a data protection
impact report prior to implementation.

‘ To provide effective mechanisms so that monitored individuals can react to
the surveillance operation.

To present reports with statistics and results of the implemented service.

To draft law on data protection applied to public security.

To implement a privacy and data protection regulatory sandbox for Al systems
aimed at public security.
